Assumptions:

-A customer can rent only one car at a time and can not rent
again until he/she returns the rented car (hence customer entity
has 1:1 relation with vehicle entity).

-Customer Id can not be updated while updating customer details.

-Request that are sent to the endpoints are in JSON format.


Notes:

-The field types image describe the data type of each entity attribute
in the ERD diagram which was required to be delivered.

-I used Postman to send post requests to the endpoints and debug my code.
